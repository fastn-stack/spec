-- ds.page: `fastn` Specification

This document describes the specification of the `fastn` language. It is not intended as
tutorial.

This is not yet a formal document. It is a work in progress, and written in relatively plain
English. The goal is to make this an unambiguous document that can be used to implement `fastn`,
and any contribution is welcome.

Currently there is only one implementation of `fastn`, but other alternate implementation are
welcome.

-- ds.h1: Purpose Of The Language

`fastn` language is a HTTP / User Interface language. A `fastn` program is a fullstack web
application. The HTTP part, and the User Interface, can be implemented in many ways. The
`fastn` compiler/runtime accepts a "path", eg `/hello/` as the entrypoint along with the
name of main `fastn`, and returns the JSON or User Interface.

`fastn /` on terminal for example, when running from inside a folder containing a fastn
package will show terminal based user interface as described by our UI language. If
the author of the package wanted, `/` (or any path) can return a JSON, in which case
the output would be the JSON, and printed on terminal/piped into file.

`fastn serve` can start a http server, and the request to the server from browser will
render the UI as described by the `fastn` language as a web page. If the author of the
fastn package want, they can return JSON, in which case the JSON will be returned to
browser with right content type.

Instead of JSON authors can chose to return YML etc also, further, a UI also has backing
data, so instead of getting the UI, the client can do content negotiation, and request
the backing data as JSON or YML etc as well.

-- ds.h1: Target

`fastn` programs are invoked with a target. The target can be `stdio` for pure text output,
`terminal` for ncurses based terminal UI, `web` for Web Browsers, `windows`, `osx`, `linux`,
`ios`, `android` and so on.

The way UI is rendered, and what UI capabilities are dependent on the target. A `fastn`
program can use `target` as a switch to provide different UI for different targets.

`fastn` has a minimum ui abstraction, in the form of `ftd.*` components, that are available
on all supported `fastn` targets. Each target can also specify its own components, and
are only available on that target.

-- ds.h2: Target Specific Libraries

Target can also specify libraries that are available only on that target. There is a
target native way to define UI components, and library functions, that are available
when using that target. fastn ui components can use these target specific components,
and fastn user defined functions can call target specific functions.

-- ds.h2: Target Neutral Vs Target Dependent Code

When writing code, authors can write target neutral code, or target dependent code.
Most programs would use target neutral code, and only use target dependent code when
absolutely necessary.


-- ds.h1: Main `fastn` Package

`fastn` code is organised as packages. There is a main package, which is the entrypoint of
the `fastn` program. The main package is the package that is invoked when the `fastn` program
is run.

-- ds.h1: File Path Based Routing

`fastn` programs take route, and other request input, as parameter. The `route` or `path`
is converted to a file path, and the file path is used to find the `fastn` module within
the fastn package.

-- ds.h2: Dynamic Routes

`fastn` package can have dynamic routes. The dynamic routes are specified in `FASTN.ftd`
file, and the dynamic routes are used to find the `fastn` module within the package.

The dynamic routes can contain wildcards, and the wildcards are used to extract values
from the route, and these values are passed to the `fastn` module.


-- ds.h1: `fastn` Package

`fastn` compiler works at package level. `fastn` files have an extension, `.ftd` and they are
organised into `fastn` packages. Each `fastn` package has a mandatory `FASTN.ftd` file at the
root level.

A `fastn` package contains `ftd` files, and many other kind of files, JS files, CSS files,
PNG/JPEG, Font files and so on.

A `fastn` package can be created to distribute static files as well, not just ftd files.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn
\-- fastn.package: hello-world

-- ds.h1: `fastn` modules

Any ftd file in a fastn package is a "fastn module". A fastn package is composed of zero or
more modules, and zero or more static files.

fastn modules can also be created using `ftd.module` syntax:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.module foo: ;;

-- ds.h1: `p-script`

The `fastn` files are composed of "sections", described in 02-p1 chapter. Each


-- ds.h1: Comments

-- ds.h2: Line Comments

`fastn` uses `;;` as line comment character. Everything from the first ``;;` till the end
of line is comment. Comments can be escaped by prefixing a backslash character: `\;;`.
Literal backslash can be inserted by putting two backslashes, `\\`.


-- ds.h2: Structural Comments

Entire "section" can be commented out by adding a `/` in the front of the section, e.g.,

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\/-- ftd.text:

this is also commented out, because this is the body of the section, that started in
the line beginning with `--`, but it contains, `/--`, commenting out everything till
the next section or the end of file.

\-- ftd.text: next section, not commented

-- ds.markdown:

In `0.4` we also allow `/` to comment out entire body, but we are deprecating that in
`0.5`.

`/` can also be added in any of the section header, both simple and multi-line, to comment
out the entire header.
